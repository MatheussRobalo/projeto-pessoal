-----------------------

Dattacle is a fast-flowing cursive typeface that fuses classic tattoo script with modern brush calligraphy. It moves with confident elegance, its pointed strokes shaped like swift blades, dancing between tradition and flair. 

The letterforms lean forward with a determined rhythm, while tense curves and sharp edges combine to create a look that's both rebellious and refined. Each character is drawn with motion in mind, as if written mid-air with a loaded brush, creating a visual tempo that's bold yet balanced. The contrasting weights across the family—from Thin to Black—allow expressive layering and impactful hierarchy.

The font is built with advanced OpenType functionality and guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures and more automatic and manual features; all to give you full control and customizability. 
It has extensive lingual support, covering all Latin-based languages, from North Europa to South Africa, from America to South-East Asia. It contains all characters and symbols you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers. 

Designed and produced by Mans Greback, a type designer and lettering artist specialized in high-quality calligraphy and script fonts for over a decade.
